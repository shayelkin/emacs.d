# Introduction

TO-DO

# Requirements

I use Emacs 29.1 on macOS and Debian Linux, and do not bother to test my init files in environments
I don't use. But as far as I can tell, there is nothing in this files that should not work in Emacs
27 running in a Unix-like environment (and most should work in Windows as well). YMMV, of course. 

Aside from Emacs itself, the only other requirement before using those files, is
[use-package](https://github.com/jwiegley/use-package), which I use to organize the configuration.

# Errors

I can not claim credit to most of the code herein: it was found online when searching for solutions
to issues I had with Emacs at the time, and I did not bother to keep a link to the source once I
copied the solution into my init.el.

As such, any errors should not be attributed to me, but to the authors I copied from.
